A script to allow the Raspberry Pi to connect to a know WiFi router or automatically generate an Internet Hotspot Access Point if no network is found. You can then use `SSH` or `VNC` on the move and switch between the hotspot and network without a reboot.

What it Sets Up
------------
* HostAPD (Access Point) on `wlan0`
* WiFi Connection on `wlan1` or `eth0`

Requirements
------------

Auto-WiFi-Hotspot supports:

* Kali-Linux ([2016.2+](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images/#1493408272250-e17e9049-9ce8))
* Two WiFi Cards (e.g. On-board chip + [TL-WN725N](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008IFXQFU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1))
* Micro-USB to USB 2.0/3.0 converter (e.g. [USB to Micro-USB Charge & Sync Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SVVY844/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1))
* Portable Battery Bank (e.g. [Anker PowerCore 5000](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CU1EC6Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1))

Older versions may work but aren't regularly tested. Bug reports for older
versions are welcome.

*Note: some WiFi dongles don't work in `adhoc mode` or don't work with with the `nl80211 driver` used in this guide for the `Raspberry Pi 3`, so consult your WiFi dongle manual before starting.*

Install
-------

Download, review, then execute the script:

```
git clone git://github.com/NicholasAdamou/Raspberry-Pi-Auto-WiFi-Hotspot-Switch-Internet.git && cd Raspberry-Pi-Auto-WiFi-Hotspot-Switch-Internet && ./src/setup.sh
```

Follow the on-screen directions.

It should take less than 5 minutes to install.
